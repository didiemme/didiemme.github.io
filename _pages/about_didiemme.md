I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science in 2005 and 2010, respectively, from the University of Catania. I earned my PhD in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2019, also from the University of Catania. I have been a member of the IPLAB research group (University of Catania) since 2015. I am the author of papers in international book chapters, journals, and conference proceedings.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, and Machine Learning, with a focus on Scene Understanding and Domain Adaptation. From October 2019 to November 2022, I was a researcher in the Department of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Catania.

Currently, I am investigating 3D Reconstruction, Neural Rendering, and Autonomous Robots in indoor environments at Next Vision s.r.l.
