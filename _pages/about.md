I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree in computer science
in 2005 and 2010 respectively from the University of Catania. I received
my PhD in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2019 from the University
of Catania. I am member of the IPLAB (University of Catania) research
group since 2015. I'm author of papers in international book chapters,
international journals and international conference proceedings. My
research interests concern Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, and
Machine Learning, with focus on Scene Understanding and Domain
Adaptation. From October 2019 until October 2020 I was a researcher
at Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Catania.

Currently, I am investigating 3D reconstruction and Autonomous Robots in indoor envirnoments.

I am currently Senior Research Engineer at [Next Vision s.r.l.](https://www.nextvisionlab.it/).
